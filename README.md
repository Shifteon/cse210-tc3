My name is Mosiah Hazen. I am a software engineering student.
I like to snowboard and longboard, pretty much anything with
a board. I got married a few months ago to my amazing wife 
and we are big nerds. We play Magic and D&D and spend too 
much money doing that. 

Hi! My name is Michael Smith. I am from Las Vegas, NV. 
I am a software engineering major, 
and love to go longboarding, play ping pong, and playing video games. 
My family consists of my two parents, me, and my sister. 
This is my first time coding in C#.

I'm from Kennesaw, GA and I'm a software engineering major. I transferred from Kennesaw State University in GA, so while this is my sixth semester overall, this is only my third semester here at BYUI. Apart from coding, I also draw a bit in my spare time.
